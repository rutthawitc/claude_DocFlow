### 💡 Lessons Learned

#### Key Issues Resolved:
1. **Next.js 15 + Turbopack**: Connectivity issues resolved by avoiding Turbopack in dev
2. **Session Management**: Username vs database ID mapping required careful handling
3. **Role Assignment**: Auto-assignment logic needed debugging for existing users
4. **Date Fields**: Drizzle ORM expects string dates, not Date objects
5. **Component Architecture**: Server components cannot pass functions to client components

#### Best Practices Applied:
- Comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Proper separation of client/server components
- Role-based access control with auto-assignment
- Secure file handling and validation
- Mobile-responsive UI design
- Complete audit trail logging

**System Status: 🟢 FULLY OPERATIONAL**
