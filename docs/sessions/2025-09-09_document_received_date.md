# DocFlow: Document Received Date Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-09
## Branch: add-features

### Feature Overview: Document Received Date

#### Key Changes
- Added new `doc_received_date` column to `documents` table
- Implemented optional date picker in document upload form
- Updated database schema migration
- Modified API endpoints to handle new field
- Added client and server-side validation schemas
- Enhanced document detail page layout

#### Motivation
Improve document tracking capabilities by allowing users to specify the exact date they received the original document from a branch.

#### Implementation Details
- Optional date field using Thai Buddhist era calendar
- Positioned next to branch dropdown for intuitive user experience
- Allows backdating and future dates with configurable range
- Integrated with existing document validation framework

#### Database Schema Update
```sql
ALTER TABLE documents 
ADD COLUMN doc_received_date DATE NULL;
```

#### Validation Rules
- Date must be within configurable past/future year range
- Can be `NULL` if not specified
- Uses server-side and client-side Zod schema validation

#### Next Steps
- Write unit tests for new validation logic
- Update documentation with feature details
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Prepare for integration into main branch

#### Performance Considerations
- Minimal database schema change
- No significant performance impact
- Optional field prevents mandatory data entry

#### Localization
- Fully supports Thai Buddhist era calendar
- Consistent with existing date handling patterns in DocFlow system
