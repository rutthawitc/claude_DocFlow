## Critical Issue Resolution: District Manager Document Access

### Problem
District manager users with BA 1059 were unable to see document counts on the documents overview page due to multi-layered access control issues.

### Resolved Components
1. **Backend Authentication**
   - Fixed `getUserAccessibleBranches` function in document service
   - Ensured district_manager role has comprehensive branch access

2. **Document Query**
   - Updated document count query to include all document statuses
   - Removed draft status exclusion
   - Improved query flexibility for district manager role

3. **Frontend Filtering**
   - Corrected branch filtering logic in BranchOverview component
   - Added explicit district_manager role check
   - Implemented comprehensive role-based access control

### Technical Details
- **Affected Roles**: District Manager (BA 1059)
- **Components Modified**:
  - Document Service (Backend)

2. Traced document count query limitations
3. Debugged frontend role filtering
4. Implemented comprehensive logging

### Next Steps
- Perform thorough testing across all district manager accounts
