# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Docflow app is a comprehensive document management system designed to streamline document tracking and management between districts and branches for disbursement documents. The system leverages the existing PWA authentication infrastructure and implements a role-based workflow for document processing, status tracking, and notifications. The application supports real-time status updates, Telegram notifications, and comprehensive audit trails while integrating seamlessly with the current PostgreSQL database and Next.js architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an uploader, I want to upload PDF documents with metadata so that I can send disbursement documents to specific branches efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an uploader accesses the upload page THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface that accepts only PDF files up to 10MB
2. WHEN a user drags and drops a PDF file THEN the system SHALL validate the file type and size before accepting it
3. WHEN uploading a document THEN the system SHALL require branch selection, MT number, MT date, subject, and month/year fields
4. WHEN all required fields are completed THEN the system SHALL enable the save and send actions
5. WHEN a document is saved as draft THEN the system SHALL store it with "draft" status
6. WHEN a document is sent THEN the system SHALL change status to "sent_to_branch" and trigger Telegram notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a branch user, I want to view and manage documents assigned to my branch so that I can process them according to workflow requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a branch user logs in THEN the system SHALL display only documents assigned to their branch based on their BA code
2. WHEN viewing the documents list THEN the system SHALL show documents sorted by upload date (newest first) with status badges
3. WHEN clicking on a document THEN the system SHALL display the PDF viewer with document metadata and comment section
4. WHEN adding a comment THEN the system SHALL save it with timestamp and user information
5. WHEN updating document status to "acknowledged" THEN the system SHALL record the status change with audit trail
6. WHEN sending a document back to district THEN the system SHALL change status to "sent_back_to_district"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a branch manager, I want to view documents from all branches in my region so that I can oversee the document processing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a branch manager logs in THEN the system SHALL display documents from all 22 branches in region R6
2. WHEN viewing the branch overview THEN the system SHALL show document counts with red badges for pending items
3. WHEN accessing branch-specific documents THEN the system SHALL display all documents for that branch with filtering options
4. WHEN approving documents THEN the system SHALL update status and log the approval action
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide branch-level analytics and metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to access comprehensive dashboard and analytics so that I can monitor system performance and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics including total documents, status distribution, and branch statistics
2. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL show bar charts for documents per branch, pie charts for status distribution, and line charts for trends
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed tables with export capabilities
4. WHEN monitoring activity THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive audit logs with user actions and timestamps
5. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL show average processing times and workflow efficiency metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to receive real-time notifications so that I can stay informed about document status changes and new submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded and sent THEN the system SHALL send a Telegram notification to the designated group
2. WHEN a document status changes THEN the system SHALL log the activity with user, timestamp, and details
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include branch name, subject, MT number, and month/year information
4. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL record comprehensive activity logs for audit purposes
5. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time status updates across all user interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data management and security so that document integrity and user access are properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the existing PWA authentication infrastructure
2. WHEN determining user permissions THEN the system SHALL use role-based access control with branch-level data isolation
3. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL maintain file integrity with proper validation and storage management
4. WHEN users access documents THEN the system SHALL enforce branch-based access restrictions based on user BA codes
5. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use the existing PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data consistency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want responsive and intuitive user interface so that I can efficiently perform document management tasks across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display full layout with sidebar navigation
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design with bottom navigation and stacked layout
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header with logo, navigation, and user menu
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and loading states
5. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL integrate PDF viewer with zoom, navigation, and download capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system stakeholder, I want comprehensive reporting and analytics so that I can track system performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating performance reports THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on document processing times and user activity
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL display daily, monthly, and yearly document volume patterns
3. WHEN monitoring branches THEN the system SHALL show individual branch performance and document status distribution
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and PDF export options for reports
5. WHEN tracking system health THEN the system SHALL monitor response times, uptime, and error rates
