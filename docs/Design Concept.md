# **Design Concept: Document Management UI Revamp**

## **Core Concept**

To revamp the User Interface (UI) of the document management system to be modern, user-friendly, and help users quickly understand document statuses. The focus is on an organized data layout, reducing redundancy, and using visualization to communicate key information.

## **Key Features**

### **1\. Information Clustering**

* **Clear Separation:** The document card is divided into two main sections: **"Document Information"** (left) and **"Status & Actions"** (right), allowing users to scan for desired information easily and quickly.  
* **Reduced Density:** Supplementary details like date, file size, and author are grouped at the bottom of the information section, accompanied by meaningful icons for a cleaner and less cluttered look.

### **2\. Visual Status**

* **Progress Bar:** The review progress is presented with a progress bar, giving users an immediate overview of how far along the verification process is.  
* **Icons and Colors:** Icons (e.g., ✔️, ❗) and colors (green, orange) are used to indicate "Reviewed" and "Pending" statuses, which are processed faster by the human brain than text alone.

### **3\. Modern Aesthetics**

* **Card Design:** Utilizes a card-based design with rounded corners and subtle shadows to create depth and a modern feel.  
* **Hover Interaction:** Adds a hover effect animation when the user mouses over a card, creating interaction and making the UI feel more dynamic.  
* **Typography & Layout:** Prioritizes information using different font sizes and weights, combined with proper whitespace, to create a visually comfortable and organized layout.

### **4\. Clear Call-to-Action**

* **Primary Action:** For fully reviewed documents, a prominent, distinctly colored Primary Button for "Submit Original Document" guides the user clearly to the next step.  
* **Secondary Actions:** Secondary buttons (View, Download, Comments) are grouped with a consistent design and organized layout, ensuring they don't distract from the primary action.
