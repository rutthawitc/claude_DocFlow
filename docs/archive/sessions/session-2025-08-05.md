## Docker and Production Deployment Enhancements

### Security Improvements
- Comprehensive review and enhancement of Docker Compose configuration
- Migrated hardcoded environment variables to `.env` strategy
- Removed external port exposures for databases and services
- Implemented robust service dependencies and health checks

### Production Deployment Artifacts
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env.example` with secure default configurations
   - Implemented secure environment variable management

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Developed `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production-ready deployment
   - Created `Dockerfile.prod` with multi-stage build optimization
   - Configured logging with log rotation for improved monitoring

3. **Networking and Proxy**
   - Added Nginx configuration for secure reverse proxy
   - Configured Redis production settings in `redis.conf`

### Key Security Achievements
- Eliminated potential external service exposure
- Implemented best practices for containerized deployment
- Enhanced configuration management for different environments
- Improved build process compatibility with pnpm

### Compatibility Fixes
- Resolved pnpm approve-builds compatibility for Docker builds
- Updated `.gitignore` for comprehensive security and file management

### Next Steps
- Conduct thorough testing of production Docker configurations
- Perform security audit of new deployment artifacts
- Update documentation with detailed deployment instructions
